Lab Rectangle

Purpose: The purpose of this lab is to teach you how to input data, calculate values, and display the results.

Description:
1. Open the Math Labs file in Repl.it/teams, there is a lab already set up named Rectangle.java. You will copy the lab into the Main.java in order for it to run.
 
2. Remember to import the Scanner class (import java.util.Scanner;).
3. Create a reference variable for keyboard input (Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);)
4. Prompt the user to input width and length of a rectangle.Use the print method instead of println so that the input is beside the prompt.
5. Use the nextInt() method and assign the values entered to appropriately named variables.
6. Calculate and display the perimeter and area. The formulas are: 
P = 2L + 2W and A = L * W


Run the program several times to test your program. Sample input and output is shown below.
 
Sample Output: (you will use these to check your code)

Rectangle
Enter the length: 12
Enter the width: 5

The perimeter is 34
The area is 60

Rectangle
