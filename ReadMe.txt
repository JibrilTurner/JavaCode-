Lab: String Conditionals


Purpose: This lab was designed to teach you about nested conditional statements and review the length method of the String class.

Description 80 pts:
1. You will create a new file named StringConditionals.java (DONE...currently named Main.java because of Repl.it)


2. Remember to import the Scanner class (import java.util.Scanner;).

3. Create a reference variable for keyboard input

4. Create two String variables word1 and word2.

5. Prompt the user to enter a word. Use the print method instead of println so that the input is beside the prompt.

6. Use the next() method and assign the value entered to one of the string variables.

7. Repeat steps 4 and 5. You now have two strings.

8. Compare the size of the two words and display whether or not the two have the same number of characters (The length() method will be useful).

9. Copy and paste code so that you can enter three different sets of words to test your code.


Description 100 pts:
Use nested if statements. If the two strings have the same number of characters, display that
message, otherwise state which string is longer.


Sample Output - 80 pts:
Enter a word: chicken
Enter another word: turkey
chicken does not have the same number of characters as turkey

Enter a word: hello
Enter another word: howdy
hello has the same number of characters as howdy

Enter a word: C++
Enter another word: Java
C++ C++ Java


Sample Output - 100 pts:
Enter a word: chicken
Enter another word: turkey
chicken has more characters than turkey

Enter a word: hello
Enter another word: howdy
hello has the same number of characters as howdy

Enter a word: C++
Enter another word: Java
Java has more characters than C++
