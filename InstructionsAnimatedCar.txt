Lab Goal : This lab was designed to teach you how to use if statements in Java. Look at the sample program, Animation.java in your labs_conditionals folder for help with this lab. The starting file is AnimatedCar.java

Lab Description : 
80 points: Draw some type of car on the screen and then move that car across the screen over and over
again. Every time the timer fires, it will call the paint method. In the paint method, after drawing your car, increase the value of the x coordinate by 50 pixels so the car will be drawn in a new location the next time paint is called. If the value of x reaches or exceeds the right side of the window, reset it back to zero. You can use the getWidth() method in the condition of the if statement.

100 points : Add an if statement to increment the y variable so the car will move down the screen every time the x value is reset to 0. You will need to add another if statement to reset y to 50 once you reach the bottom of the screen â€“ use
getHeight().

NOTE: I HIGHLY RECOMMEND START BY MAKING THE SQUARE GIVEN TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION
YOU ARE ASKED FOR YOUR CAR TO MOVE, THEN ADD THE DETAIL TO IT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A
CAR. An example of what square code may look like is page.fillRect(90+x, 90+y, 50,60)
